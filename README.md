# Shop-Easy
Basically its a product which will make shopping centers autonomous. This app will make lives of people easier by reducing their effort to stand in long queues for billing at shopping counters by integrating Cloud Platform along with Internet of Things. So in the mobile application, each customer can login and search for all the nearby shops and check if the item they want to buy is there or not. This will also assist you in reaching to the shopping center by navigation. As you reach there, you will collect the "Smart-Kart" which will have a RFID reader on it and it will get connected with your mobile app. Using the RFID reader in the Smart Kart, it will read the RFID tag embedded on the product and check certain information. After buying all the required product customer can check out by paying online, so it will be entirely a cashless transaction system. Using this product we can check availability of the items which we want to buy from our home. So this technology will definitely make lives of customers quite easier. The detailed idea of the product has been described in the presentation attached.
